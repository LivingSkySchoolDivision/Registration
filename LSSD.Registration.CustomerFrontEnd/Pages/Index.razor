                Pre-K programs support the overall development of young children and lay the foundation for school success and lifelong learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pre-K is intended to be a prevention and early intervention program. Therefore, a priority is given to children who are at risk or most vulnerable. Applications are reviewed by a selection committee who will inform parents of decisions made about entry into the program.
