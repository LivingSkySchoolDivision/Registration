                    Pre-K programs support the overall development of young children and lay the foundation for school success and lifelong learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pre-K is intended to be a prevention and early intervention program. Therefore, a priority is given to children who are at risk or most vulnerable. Applications are reviewed by a selection committee who will inform parents of decisions made about entry into the program.
